# 5050ValueGrowth-Strategy
This is an analysis of a strategy where you invest 50/50 in S&amp;P500 Value (IVE) and S&amp;P500 Growth (IVW). Stock information is pulled in from Yahoo Finance. I've added a loop function to test multiple time periods at once to create a histogram of results that allows for a better analysis of the strategy over multiple periods.
